## Requirements
Bullet points of requirements/basic overview of problem

Problem Statement: 
A new hotel needs a booking and management system to keep track of bookings. Management needs a front end for customers to book a hotel room, and a database containing all booking information, including dates/customer information. It can block out dates that are unavailable and (potentially) handle changing/cancelling bookings.

## TODO

We can deal with assignments later and actual things like task assignment later.

### Start

Copy over the files from the example project. (I'm going to take from my own website project)
